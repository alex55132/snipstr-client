# Snipstr Client

## Description

Snipstr is a self hosted tool created for allowing text content (snippets) to be sent securely to other devices.

## How does it work?

By using the UI you can create a text snippet and password protect it (or not), so you will be able to check it out later via the generated link.

The provided password is hashed and used to encrypt the text content using AES algorithm.
